# AutoMate -- Project on predicting BusynessNYC
The project aimed to develop an intuitively designed application named AutoMate which caters specifically to drivers navigating Manhattan. By harnessing historical data and leveraging advanced machine learning models, the application anticipates congestion levels across distinct zones within Manhattan. This predictive insight is then amalgamated to provide users with an informed projection of the anticipated occupancy at various parking facilities through a user-friendly interface. The application is developed from the ground up using cutting-edge technology stack across all facets of its development. Our team worked collaboratively over the course of 12 weeks and found that the application works as anticipated while exceeding expectations in other areas. The end product can be further refined and improved to facilitate additional functionalities while attracting more customers within the target demographic.
